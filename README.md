# List of Hotmails used to skip The Microsoft Account Configuration
Hi there! This is a list of Hotmails created by me for you! (Every hotmail listed on here has a password, and the password is "1234A@78". (Please note that every Hotmail here is for Account creation, nothing else, after you create an account, it's recommended to create a local account after using a Hotmail)

# Where do I get the hotmail?
Just go to the different file named "Hotmails"!
