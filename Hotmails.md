# Hotmails
Rules of using a Hotmail:
1 - The Hotmails listed below are **ONLY** for account creation.
2 - It is Recommended to create a local account after creating your account using a hotmail.
3 - Hotmails listed are not safe to use, as someone could have enabled OneDrive (Which is disabled by me) and upload some files, they could've changed the password to the Hotmail.
4 - Please do NOT use that hotmail to send emails undercover!
That's all!
